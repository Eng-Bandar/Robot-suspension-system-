# Robot-suspension-system-

The robot suspension system was designed using Cinema 4D software

In the first task, the tyre was designed with the required sizes, and the foot base was redesigned to insert the wheel into it.

In the second task, the base of the upper section was developed to carry the robot and distribute weights, and the suspension system was created by fastening the tire to a cylinder to lessen vibrations during robot movement.
